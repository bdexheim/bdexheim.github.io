                        <p>After cleaning the data into usable data sets, I used javascript, d3.js, three.js and svg code on the Observable platform to explore several network relationships: <br><br> <i><b> Bullpen succession network</b></i>: What relationships within a bullpen are strongest? Whose roles are most consistent (or not)? Across teams and years, which have the most consistency? <br><br> <i><b> Archetype Creation based on psychological toll of pressure, uncertainty, and team competitiveness</b></i>: How can machine learning clustering techniques be applied to overlooked human experiences in a deeply analytical industry? <br><br> <i><b> Archetype changes over individuals' careers </b></i>: What trends exist for career changes based on the created archetypes? At the individual level, who has longevity and archetype stability vs brief careers or instability? <br><br> <i><b> Team bullpen makeup and player movement</b></i>: Based on the archetypes, what are the makeups of team bullpens per year? How do they relate to team success? Who gets traded per year? What pitchers have team stability vs many traders over their career? <br><br><br> Critique sessions influenced several design choices shows in the following media:<br><br><i>Progressive and controlled disclosure in the visualizations</i>: With the amount of data in these visualizations, showing it all at once can be overwhelming. By allowing user-controlled thresholds or filters, the user can better understand the dynamics of the data both at micro and macro levels. <br> <i>Explainers that lead into the visualizations</i>: Some users will not be data experts and some will not be baseball fanatics. By using text explainers, scrollytelling, and some basic animations, all users have the opportunity to move through the page, learn, and be inspired. Once again, progressive disclosure can be leveraged to hide some of this information from those more familiar with the content. <br> <i>Emphasize the human experience</i>: When looking at the macro-trends of the visualizations, it can be easy to lose the human experiences and this is a story of labor. By introducing several relief pitchers in the intro narrative, and then allowing the user to focus on particular pitchers in every visualization along with recommending several of interest, we can re-emphasize the unique, human experiences.</p>

                        <p>Data visualizations and experiences have the power to not only educate on the specific content, but also can teach data literacy concepts and inspire learning more. Data aesthetics are not just flashy, but can actually capture the audience's interest. <br> <br> Moving forward for similar data projects, I think expanding from interactivity and animation to include a simulation would be interesting. In this case, users perhaps could make some choices at the beginning, observe what archetype they become, make another choice, see how that changes, deal with randomness of baseball events and injuries, etc... and observe how one's career would pan out. <br><br> <i><b>What other data, experiences, and stories are we overlooking, both in baseball and beyond? </b></i> <br> <i>"There was but one question he left unasked, and it vibrated between his lines: if gross miscalculations of a person's value could occur on a baseball field, before a live audience of thirty thousand, and a television audience of millions more, what did that say about the measurement of performance in other lines of work? If professional baseball players could be over or under valued, who couldn't?"</i> - Michael Lewis about Bill James, Moneyball</p>
