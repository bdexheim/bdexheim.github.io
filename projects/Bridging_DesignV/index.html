                        <p> <i>How might we streamline the process for integrating simulation models into NI Hardware in the Loop (HIL) systems so that users can seamlessly integrate the HIL systems into their existing upstream xIL processes? </i> <br> <br> <br> Automotive and Aerospace teams were increasingly moving to optimize efficiency of embedded software test through modern software engineering practices. Traditionally, HIL teams and processes were distinct from the upstream software test teams and processes. However, with supply chain challenges, pressure to be more efficient with resources and time, and a desire to become software companies, many wanted to re-use as many components, processes, and data from upstream in HIL to reduce time to market. <br> <br> NI traditionally was a hardware test and measurement company, but with new partnerships with modeling and simulation companies, an opportunity existed to ensure NI HIL systems could still fit customer's new goals.</p>

                <h2 class="small-label">Research Process</h2>
                <p>Dozens of user interviews of customers across industries, stakeholder interviews, and reviews of instrumented product telemetry data influenced the design and implementation roadmap for streamlining simulation model integration. <br> <br> This process helped identify needs across simulation model integration for different types of users (HIL engineers vs model designers) as well as at different stages of the process.<br><br>Notably, it influenced the following high-level goals: <br><br> <i> Environment setup for compilation of simulation models should be native to the modeling tool </i> <br><br> <i>All simulation modeling capabilities should be supported </i> <br><br><i> Debugging of models during HIL execution should be possible from the HIL tool AND the modeling environment </i> <br><br> <i> Faster rates of execution (e.g. <100 us for electric motor plant models) should be enabled through native FPGA model compilation </i></p>

                <p>Prototype development and user testing with joint customers between NI and MathWorks helped refine the approaches to both the CPU and FPGA model integration workflows. <br><br> Implementation roadmaps were jointly agreed upon, with globally dispersed software teams working from both organizations. I led the roadmap development and sprint planning to guide value delivery upon each quarterly release. Bi-weekly meetings between the two organizations ensured we continued meeting our release goals and customer committments with visibility up to executive leadership.</p>

                        <p>The CPU and FPGA toolboxes have over 4k and 700 installations, respectively. <br><br>  Escalations related to model integration decreased substantially. <br><br> Users largely migrated to the new tools, reducing maintenance and support costs related to the legacy, custom toolchains, while supporting the organization's move to a software subscription model. <br><br> Users are more successful in traversing the "design-V", bridging the virtual-physical divide.</p>
